            <p class="work-section-text">I am a full stack developer. My expertise is in utilizing PHP and Java for serving and managing SQL based relational data systems to web services and sites. While I do most of my software backend work using Sun's built in HTTPS library, I have also implemented with and contributed to Microsoft's Project Casablanca, an HTTPS server library in C++ 11. I also have significant experience in Windows Forms and WPF with VB.net and C# for desktop application development as well as Android application development. I spend a lot of my time working on data management. My recent projects have used MariaDB (MySQL) for data storage but I am also experienced in using SQLite for Windows desktop and Android development.</p>
